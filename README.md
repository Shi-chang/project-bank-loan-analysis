# Overview
Blue Bank is a bank in USA that has a loan department which is currently understaffed. They supply loans to individuals and don’t have much reporting on how risky these
borrowers are. Using Python and Tableau, they’d like to see a report of the level of risks of loans. This project provides the report.

# What I have learned
1. Obtain data from JSON file in Python with json, process, clean, and store data to a CSV file.
2. Analyze the risks of loans by creating charts indicating the distribution of loans based on interest rates, utilization rates, annual incomes and credit scores.
